# Event Sourced Customer Registry Subscriber Sample

## Designing

To understand the Kalix concepts that are the basis for this example, see [Designing services](https://docs.kalix.io/java/development-process.html) in the documentation.

The project `java-protobuf-eventsourced-customer-registry-subscriber` is a downstream consumer of the Service to Service event stream provided by `java-protobuf-eventsourced-customer-registry` project.

## Building

Use Maven to build your project:

```shell
mvn compile
```

### NOTE
**In order to compile you will need to set up a Secure Repository Token [as instructed here](https://account.akka.io/token).**

## Running Locally

First start the `java-protobuf-eventsourced-customer-registry` service and proxy. It will run with the default service and proxy ports (`8080` and `9000`).

To start your service locally, run:

```shell
mvn kalix:runAll
```

### Create a customer

```shell
grpcurl --plaintext -d '{"customer_id": "wip", "email": "wip@example.com", "name": "Very Important", "address": 
{"street": "Road 1", "city": "The Capital"}}' localhost:9001  customer.action.CustomerAction/Create
```

This call is made on the subscriber service and will be forwarded to the `java-protobuf-eventsourced-customer-registry` service.

### Run a view query from this project

```shell
grpcurl --plaintext localhost:9001 customer.view.AllCustomersView/GetCustomers
```

The subscriber service will receive updates from customer-registry via service-to-service stream and update the view.

### Change name

```shell
grpcurl --plaintext -d '{"customer_id": "wip", "new_name": "Most Important"}' localhost:9000 customer.api.CustomerService/ChangeName
```

This call is performed on the customer-registry directly.
  
### Check the view again

```shell
grpcurl --plaintext localhost:9001 customer.view.AllCustomersView/GetCustomers
```
