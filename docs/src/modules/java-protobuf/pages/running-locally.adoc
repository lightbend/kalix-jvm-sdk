= Run a service locally
:page-supergroup-java-scala: Language
include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]

Running a service locally is helpful to test and debug. The following sections provide commands for starting and stopping a single service locally.

== Prerequisites

In order to run your service locally, you'll need to have the following prerequisites:

* Docker {minimum_docker_version} or higher.
* Access to the `registry.akka.io/akka-public` container registry. This is a public container registry that provides a Kalix Runtime container suited for local development. Make sure this registry is not blocked by your firewall.

[TIP]
====
The samples provided with the Kalix SDKs all have `docker-compose` files preconfigured to run your service locally.
====

== Starting your service

To start your service locally, run the following command from the root of your project:

[.tabset]
Java::
+
--
[source, command line]
----
mvn kalix:runAll
----
--

Scala::
+
--
[source, command line]
----
sbt runAll
----
--

This command will start your Kalix service and a Kalix Runtime using the included `docker-compose.yml` file.

If you prefer, you can instead start `docker-compose` manually by running `docker-compose up` in one terminal and in another terminal start your Kalix service with:

[.tabset]
Java::
+
--
[source, command line]
----
mvn kalix:run
----
--

Scala::
+
--
[source, command line]
----
sbt run
----
--

== Invoking your service

After you start the service it will accept invocations on `localhost:9000`. You can use https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl[gRPCurl] to invoke your service.

[.group-java]
As an example, we will use the https://github.com/lightbend/kalix-jvm-sdk/tree/main/samples/java-protobuf-eventsourced-customer-registry[`customer-registry`] sample. 

[.group-scala]
As an example, we will use the https://github.com/lightbend/kalix-jvm-sdk/tree/main/samples/scala-protobuf-eventsourced-customer-registry[`customer-registry`] sample. 

You can inspect your services with the gRPC `list` and `describe` commands:

[source,command line]
----
grpcurl -plaintext localhost:9000 list

grpcurl -plaintext localhost:9000 describe customer.api.CustomerService
----

[TIP]
====
Be sure to use gRPCurl `1.8.7` (or above) since previous versions have been found to have some issues while describing an endpoint.
====

Get a customer value from the `CustomerService`:

[.tabset]
Linux or macOS::
+
--
[source,command line]
----
grpcurl \
 -d '{"customer_id": "vip", "email": "vip@example.com", "name": "Very Important", "address": {"street": "Road 1", "city": "The Capital"}}' \ 
 --plaintext localhost:9000 \
  customer.api.CustomerService/Create
----
--

- The message payload in JSON format with `-d`
- The address of the Kalix Runtime (using `plaintext` instead of TLS)
- The RPC procedure name which is deduced from the protobuf definition of the component you're calling.

  customer.api.CustomerService/Create 
----
--

- The message payload in JSON format with `-d`
- The address of the Kalix Runtime (using `plaintext` instead of TLS)
- The RPC procedure name which is deduced from the protobuf definition of the component you're calling.

== Shutting down the service

Use `Ctrl+C` to shut down the service. When stopping your service, it will also shutdown the Kalix Runtime container and any other container you have defined in `docker-compose.yml`. Unless you have chosen to start `docker-compose` manually in a separate terminal, in which case you will need to stop it manually as well.

== Running service with persistence enabled

By default, Kalix services are configured to run locally with persistence disabled. This means the Kalix Runtime will use an in-memory datastore for the state of your services. This is useful for local development since it allows you to quickly start and stop your service without having to worry about cleaning the database.

However, if you want to run your service with persistence enabled to keep the data when restarting, you may update the `docker-compose` file as below.

[source, dockerfile, indent=0]
----
include::example$scala-protobuf-doc-snippets/docker-compose.yml[tag=persistence-mode]
----
<1> Maps local directory to the Kalix Runtime database directory `/var/kalix`.
<2> Sets `PERSISTENCE_ENABLED` environment variable to `true`.

== Running multiple services locally

A typical Kalix application is composed of one or more services deployed to the same Kalix project. When deployed under the same Kalix project, two different services can make xref:call-another-service.adoc[calls to each other] or xref:service-to-service.adoc[subscribe to each other's event streams] by simply using their logical names.

The same can be done on your local machine by configuring the services to run on different ports and by configuring them to "_discover_" each other using some extra configurations. 

In this section, we will show you how to configure your local development environment to run two services and have them call each other.

[.group-java]
For that we will use two of our existing samples: https://github.com/lightbend/kalix-jvm-sdk/tree/main/samples/java-protobuf-eventsourced-customer-registry[`customer-registry`] and https://github.com/lightbend/kalix-jvm-sdk/tree/main/samples/java-protobuf-eventsourced-customer-registry-subscriber[`customer-registry-subscriber`].

[.group-scala]
For that we will use two of our existing samples: https://github.com/lightbend/kalix-jvm-sdk/tree/main/samples/scala-protobuf-eventsourced-customer-registry[`customer-registry`] and https://github.com/lightbend/kalix-jvm-sdk/tree/main/samples/scala-protobuf-eventsourced-customer-registry-subscriber[`customer-registry-subscriber`].

The *customer-registry* sample provides a service to register customers and the *customer-registry-subscriber* subscribes to an event stream produced by the *customer-registry* service, building a xref:views.adoc[View] from it.

=== Customer Registry Sample

The `docker-compose.yml` file from *customer-registry* is left untouched and use the usual default ports. The user service will run on port 8080 and the Kalix Runtime on port 9000.

[source,yml,indent=0]
----
include::java-protobuf:example$java-protobuf-eventsourced-customer-registry/docker-compose.yml[tag=customer-registry]
----

=== Customer Registry Subscriber Sample

On the other hand, in the *customer-registry-subscriber* we will use port 8081 and 9001 respectively to avoid port conflicts with the *customer-registry* service.
The ports can be configured in the `.env` located at the project's root folder.

[source,bash,indent=0]
----
include::java-protobuf:partial$env-file.txt[tag=env-file]
----

Moreover, since *customer-registry-subscriber* needs to subscribe to *customer-registry* and since we will be running it on our local machine, we need to _show_ it where to find the *customer-registry* service.

This is done by passing an extra property (`kalix.dev-mode.service-port-mappings.customer-registry`) to its Kalix Runtime to let it create a mapping between the logical name *customer-registry* and the host and port where the *customer-registry* service is running.

Note that you need to add service port mappings to the Kalix Runtime configuration for the service that depends on the other service. Here, *customer-registry-subscriber* depends on *customer-registry*, therefore we add the service port mapping to the Kalix Runtime associated with the *customer-registry-subscriber*.

[source,yml,indent=0]
----
include::java-protobuf:example$java-protobuf-eventsourced-customer-registry-subscriber/docker-compose.yml[tag=customer-registry-subscriber]
----

With both services configured, we can start them independently by running  [.group-java]#`mvn kalix:runAll`# [.group-scala]#`sbt runAll`# in two separate terminals. 

From a third terminal, we can create a customer on *customer-registry* service.

[.tabset]
Linux or macOS::
+
--
[source,command line]
----
grpcurl \
 -d '{"customer_id": "vip", "email": "vip@example.com", "name": "Very Important", "address": {"street": "Road 1", "city": "The Capital"}}' \ 
 --plaintext localhost:9000 \
  customer.api.CustomerService/Create
----
--
Windows 10+::
+
--
[source,command line]
----
grpcurl ^ 
 -d '{"customer_id": "vip", "email": "vip@example.com", "name": "Very Important", "address": {"street": "Road 1", "city": "The Capital"}}' ^ 
 --plaintext localhost:9000 ^
  customer.api.CustomerService/Create 
----
--

While watching the logs in *customer-registry-subscriber* service, we will see it receiving the customer created event. After that we can query its View.

[source,shell]
----
grpcurl --plaintext localhost:9001 customer.view.AllCustomersView/GetCustomers
----

== Running other services with Docker

In the previous example, we run two services independently with [.group-java]#`mvn kalix:runAll`# [.group-scala]#`sbt runAll`#. Each time, the service is started together with a Kalix Runtime running in a Docker container.

An alternative is to build a larger `docker-compose` file containing dependent services. In the case of *customer-registry-subscriber*, we can have a second `docker-compose` file containing a Kalix Runtime for *customer-registry-subscriber*, a Kalix Runtime for *customer-registry* and the *customer-registry* itself. 

At the root of the *customer-registry-subscriber* service, we can find an alternative `docker-compose` file called `docker-compose-integration.yml`. 

[source,yml,indent=0]
----
include::java-protobuf:example$java-protobuf-eventsourced-customer-registry-subscriber/docker-compose-integration.yml[tag=customer-registry-docker]
----

But first, we need to build an image for *customer-registry*. For local development, we don't need to publish it to a remote container registry. It suffices to build it locally. 

We can build the image by calling the following command at the root of  *customer-registry*:

[.tabset]
Java::
+
--
[source, command line]
----
mvn package docker:build
----
--

Scala::
+
--
[source, command line]
----
sbt docker:publishLocal
----
--

Next we can run *customer-registry-subscriber* and instead pass `docker-compose-integration.yml` to it. 

Run the following command at the root of *customer-registry-subscriber*:

[.tabset]
Java::
+
--
[source, command line]
----
mvn -Dkalix.dev-mode.docker-compose-file=docker-compose-integration.yml kalix:runAll
----
--

Scala::
+
--
[source, command line]
----
sbt -Dkalix.dev-mode.docker-compose-file=docker-compose-integration.yml runAll
----
--

This time,  [.group-java]#`mvn kalix:runAll`# [.group-scala]#`sbt runAll`# will start `docker-compose-integration.yml` instead. The *customer-registry* service and its companion Kalix Runtime will run alongside *customer-registry-subscriber* and its own Kalix Runtime. 

Note that the configuration is exactly the same except that now we are running one single [.group-java]#`mvn kalix:runAll`# [.group-scala]#`sbt runAll`# command and the `docker-compose` file we are using contains all the dependencies required by *customer-registry-subscriber*.

This approach can be extended to any service you might want to integrate with. It can be any other Kalix service that you plan to deploy to the same Kalix project or even external services. The only requirement is to have a Docker image for it.
