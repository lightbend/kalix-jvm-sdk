Timers allow for scheduling calls in the future. For example, to verify that some process have been completed or not.

Timers are persisted in the https://docs.kalix.io/reference/glossary.html#runtime[Kalix Runtime] and are guaranteed to run at least once.

When a timer is triggered, the scheduled call is executed. If successfully executed, the timer completes and is automatically removed.
In case of a failure, the timer is rescheduled with a delay of 3 seconds. This process repeats until the call succeeds.

You can schedule a timer for any service method in Kalix, but you can only create a timer from within an Action or Workflow by passing a `DeferredCall`.

**Timer features**:

* Timers are guaranteed to run at least once.
* Timers can be scheduled to run at any time in the future.
* Timers can be cancelled.
* Timers are automatically removed once successfully completed.
* Timers are re-scheduled in case of failures.
* Timers failing can be limited to a maximum number of retries.

**Timer limitations**:

* Timers can only be scheduled from within an Action or Workflow.
* Timers can only call other components (e.g., Actions, Entities, Workflows), therefore external service calls must be wrapped by an Action in the deployed service.
